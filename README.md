### About Me ðŸš€
Currently, I am pursuing my master's in Data Analytic Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston. During my coursework and internship, I've worked on R, SQL, Python, and Tableau for maintaining large databases and used various professional statistical techniques to collect, analyze, and interpret data. Additionally, I worked on cleaning, reformatting, pre-processing, and visualizing data to understand data better and identify trends in data.<p>

My interests mainly lie in Data Analytics and Data Science which is a fast-paced, challenging career centered on problem-solving and thinking outside of the box.<p>

My diversified experience includes proficiency in multiple technologies such as:<br/>

Languages: R, Python, SQL, HTML <br/>
Databases: MySQL, NoSQL, MongoDB <br/>
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Dash, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Lubridate, Dplyr, Ggplot, Knitr <br/>
Software: Jupyter, Google Colab, Pycharm, R-studio, Tableau, Alteryx, Jira, Flourish Studio, Data Wrapper, PowerBI, MS Office <br/>
